The BiblioPixel Tutorial
------------------------------

The tutorial steps you through all the features of BiblioPixel, starting with
creating a simple project and going onto advanced topics like Controls.

Creating BiblioPixel projects is quite easy, and we have tried hard to give you
clear error messages when you do make a mistake - and the `mailing list
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/maniacal-labs-users>`_ is always a click
away.
