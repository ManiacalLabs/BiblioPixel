The ``driver`` Section
------------------------------------------

The ``driver`` section define the hardware or virtual outputs that actually
display your lighting patterns.

The ``driver`` Section is a Class Section, and therefore its Fields depend on
the specific type of Driver.

We have the following driver classes built into BiblioPixel:
[TODO-API: link to the autogenerated docs here]

``artnet``
  Broadcasts data to ArtNet

``curses``
  Creates a colored display on your terminal using curses

``dummy``
  A driver that does nothing

``gif_writer``
  Writes animated GIFs representing the project

``hue``
  Controls Philips Hue bulbs

``mirror``
  A driver that warps a list of other drivers that are mirroring:
  displaying the same data

``network``
  A driver that sends the pixels to a receiver over an IP socket connection

``simpixel``
  Send layout and pixels to a OpenGL driver running in the browser

``SPI```
  Interfaces with the SPI ports on a raspberry pi or similar device

**Example 1**\ : A ``driver`` Section for an SPI device

.. code-block:: yaml

  driver:
    typename: SPI
    ledtype: WS2801
    interface: PERIPHERY

``text``
  Print out the r, g, b levels of each pixel on each frame.
  Spews out huge amounts of data - only good for debugging

``PiWS281X``
  Drives the WS281X strips on the Raspberry Pi

``Serial``
  All strips run by a serial (USB) device, particularly the AllPixel and
  PiPixel.  This driver is important enough to have its own page later.

``SPI``
  This is the base class for all types of strips connected to an SPI bus
  as found on the Raspberry Pi and other small machines.  This driver also has
  its own page.


**Example 1**\ : A ``driver`` Section for a serial device

.. code-block:: yaml

   driver:
     c_order: BRG
     gamma: [1.1, 0.5, 0]
     ledtype: LPD8806
     typename: serial
     device_id: 1


.. bp-code-block:: footer

   shape: [64, 16]
   animation:
     typename: $bpa.matrix.MathFunc
     func: 17
     palette: trendy
